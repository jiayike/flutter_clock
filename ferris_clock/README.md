# Ferris Clock

First implementation of a Flutter project for the Flutter Clock Challenge [flutter.dev/clock](https://flutter.dev/clock). 

Please forgive me for the noob codes >.<

## Features
- Each beam represents the hour hand
- When the pod is lit, it means the hour has passed
- Minutes is shown on the beam as gradient
- The wheel rotation represents seconds

## TODOs:

- [ ] Tests cases
- [ ] Use stream instead of setState for time updating
- [ ] Optimisation
- [ ] Extract variables to separate file
